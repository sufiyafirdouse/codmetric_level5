**Rock-Paper-Scissors**

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple little project I made using Python,the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where you play against the computer. It runs right in your terminal, no fancy stuff.just pure logic and fun!

**wats inside?**
     1.You choose rock, paper, or scissors

     2.The computer picks one randomly

     3.Then the game tells you who wins 

     4.You can keep playing as long as you want

**why i built this?**     

I wanted to get better at:

    i.Taking user input

    ii.Using random in Python

    iii.Practicing if-else logic in real use cases

    iv.Writing something that actually runs and responds

**This small project helped me understand how even simple games can teach us a lot about how code flows**

 **Result:**
 
The game successfully runs in the terminal, gives real-time feedback, and lets users play until they decide to stop.
